I graduated and Commissioned as an officer in the National Guard from there and soon attended the University of Missouri where a car accident ended my Army career and left me in a wheelchair. I have since returned to the Nashville area and attend NSS with high hopes on becoming a competent and successful web developer."

The worst part is knowing that you spend 30-40 minutes just getting a line or two completed rather than pages of working code. Really spinning my wheels on quite a few concepts. It's all on me as far as practice and attention to detail go i guess. Primus concert tonight, so tired and full of back pain might not go."
