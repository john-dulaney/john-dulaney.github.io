# John Dulaney's Personal Website

[johndulaney.net](https://johndulaney.net)  <--- this link does not like my address. johndulaney.net works. Markdown is stupid.

This repo hosts files for my personal site. Its a simple single page application built using **AngularJS**, **Bootstrap**, **HTML5**, and Basic **CSS**.
